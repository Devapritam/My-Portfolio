            My hobbies are coding, playing, reading books, playing tabla and painting. I am currently learning coding in an online platform "Whitehat Jr". I was very interested to know about how games are made. Whenever I saw a game, I always thought how this game is made. So, this made me to learn coding so that I future I can also develop games. Recently, last year in 2020, Whitehat Jr organised a contest named "CEO for a day". I participated in that contest and got selected and got a chance to meet and interact with the CEO of Whitehat Jr Mr. Karan Bajaj and CEO of Byju's Classes Mr. Byju Raveendran. And at last I was declared as one of the winners of this contest and won $10,000 as a reward. Other than that, I also got selected in VVM (Vigyarthi Vigyan Manthan) Examination and Inspire Manak awards etc.</p>
